# Extended Paper Version

A **preliminary**<sup>1</sup> extended version of our paper "The Boon and Bane of Cross-Signing: Shedding Light on a Common Practice in Public Key Infrastructures" is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08772 -- an update is planned for the coming weeks.

<sup>1</sup>The preliminary version lacks some final changes applied to the camera ready version, but includes preliminary descriptions for some additional cross-signs.
