Information on OSX root stores are [published by Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202858).
Another [page of Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-bh/HT209143) even gives an overview on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
Be aware that also `always ask` and `blocked` certificates can be found on these sites.
